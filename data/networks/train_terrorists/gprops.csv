description,"A network of associations among the terrorists involved in the 2004 Madrid train bombing, as reconstructed from press stories after-the-fact. Edge weights encode four levels of connection strength: friendships, ties to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, co-participants in wars, and co-participants in previous terrorist attacks."

long-description: This undirected network contains contacts between suspected terrorists involved in the train bombing of Madrid on March 11, 2004 as reconstructed from newspapers. A node represents a terrorist and an edge between two terrorists shows that there was a contact between the two terroists. The edge weights denote how 'strong' a connection was. This includes friendship and co-participating in training camps or previous attacks.

Files: 
    meta.moreno_train -- Metadata about the network 
    out.moreno_train -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_train are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
