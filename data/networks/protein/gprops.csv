===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the maayan-pdzbase network: This is a network of protein–protein interactions from PDZBase. 


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.cc/networks/maayan-pdzbase

Files: 
    meta.maayan-pdzbase -- Metadata about the network 
    out.maayan-pdzbase -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.maayan-pdzbase are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
